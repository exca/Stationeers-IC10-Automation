# Quick Start

Getting started with our BASIC IC10 Compiler for Stationeers is quick and straightforward. Here's a quick guide to jump into coding:

1. **Download and Launch:**
   - Copy the application folder to your preferred location (no installation is required).
   - Start the application by running `BASIC IC10 Compiler - Stationeers.exe`.

2. **Begin Coding:**
   - The application opens a resizable window with three panels:
     - *Top Left Panel:* This is your primary workspace for coding in BASIC.
     - *Right Panel:* It displays the automatically generated IC 10 MIPS code.
     - *Bottom Left Panel:* This area is dedicated to error and warning messages in case the application encounters issues with your code.

3. **Coding Workflow:**
   - Type your BASIC code directly within the application. Alternatively, you can write your code in your favorite text editor and then paste it into the application.
   - Select the generated IC 10 MIPS code, copy it, and then paste it directly into the game to implement your code.
